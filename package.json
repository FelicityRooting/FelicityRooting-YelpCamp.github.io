  "description": "YelpCamp is a yelp like clone for campground, campsites and outdoor activities so you can create campground, have photos, leave comments and all sort of fun thing. Based on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS. I used Cloud9 to be my workspace because I need to install Node.js, if I'm using linux or mac, I could install them quickly. But I only have windows. So I choose Cloud9, a web linux VM. With this I do not need to care about set up environment myself. And it is free plan and open source.",
